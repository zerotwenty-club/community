This document describes how moderation occurs across the organization. It describes how people can handle Code of Conduct violations. Furthermore it describes the actions any maintainer, and specifically moderators can make.

## Table of contents

*  [Violation](#violation)
*  [Reporting](#violation)
*  [Enforcement](#enforcement)

## Violation

A **violation** is any post that violates the Code of Conduct. The core team decides what inappropriate behavior constitutes a violation.

A **post** includes activity that can be moderated, such as code, comments, commits, edits, issues, posts, or pull requests.

**Moderation** includes actions such as editing, deleting, hiding, or locking one or more posts to address violations. Not all posts can be moderated.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at `hi@dandevri.es`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

* In private, via email to one or more core team members
* In public, via a new post in the same thread as the violation 

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Reports should contain as much information and context as possible, including the URL and a screenshot of the violation. Details may be modified to obscure obscene or offensive content. 

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
